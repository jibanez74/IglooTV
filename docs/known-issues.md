## Rejected: album cover URLs are absolute and must not be "resolved"

**Found:** 2026-08-13, raised as a home-screen review comment and investigated.
**Status:** closed, no change. Recorded so it is not raised again.
**Files:** `app/src/main/java/com/igloo/blindpenguincoder/feature/home/HomeViewModel.kt:194`

A review comment argued that `HomeViewModel` passes album covers to Coil without resolving
backend-relative paths such as `/api/static/albums/...`, citing the web client's
`media-image-url.ts` as evidence that shape is supported. It is not:

- `albums.cover` has exactly two writers, `../Igloo/server/cmd/api/music_scanner.go:1029` and
  `:1106`, and both store the raw Spotify CDN URL. Nothing downloads album art into
  `static/albums/`, and that directory is empty on disk.
- The live database holds 211 albums: 190 `https://i.scdn.co/...`, 21 empty string, **zero**
  relative paths. `music_scanner_test.go:397` asserts the absolute-URL shape.
- There is no music image proxy route in `docs/openapi.json`, so there is no base URL to resolve
  against — unlike TMDB, which has `GET /api/tmdb/images/{size}/{file}`.
- `AGENTS.md:528` says to use a full Spotify image URL as provided; the shared-resolver mandate at
  `AGENTS.md:526` is scoped to TMDB path fields, which is why the movie rails call `tmdbImageUrl()`
  and the album rail does not.

The cited `media-image-url.ts` `/api` branch returns the path **unchanged** — the web client is a
same-origin SPA served by the Go binary, so the browser resolves it. It never builds an absolute
URL and says nothing about what the field contains.

If the scanner ever starts storing artwork locally this becomes real, but `IglooPosterCard` already
degrades to the music placeholder on a load error rather than showing a broken card. The genuine
relative-path bug was on avatars, where uploads really are stored as `/api/static/...`; that one
was fixed on 2026-08-14 by `avatarImageUrl` and does not apply here.
